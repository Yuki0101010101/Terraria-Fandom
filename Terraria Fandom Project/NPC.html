    <p>• NPCs are friendly automated non-playable characters that provide services to players. Standing near an NPC and pressing the Interact button will open a dialogue window with one or more options 
	for the player to select. Most NPCs are vendors, displaying a shop inventory when the "Shop" option is selected. They sell items to players in exchange for coins, and can be sold items by a player 
	to obtain coins. Some NPCs also have other options that perform other functions.</p>
	<p>• Most NPCs are town NPCs, appearing after various milestones are achieved in game advancement. They move into structures the player must provide, known as houses, which are generally required for town NPCs to remain available.</p>
	<p>• NPCs can reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases the more of them are present. With 3 or more town NPCs nearby, enemies generally stop spawning on or near the visible screen altogether </p><br>

	<h1 style="background-color:#1B4242;color:white;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;">Guide</h1><br>
	<div class ="container">
	 <p>• The Guide is usually the first NPC a player encounters. He spawns near the player when the world is created. 
	 He provides tips mainly aimed at new players and displays all crafting recipes (including the crafting station required) an item shown to him is used in.<br><br>
	 • Unlike most other NPCs, the Guide spawns upon world creation, before a house is available. He will, however, move into the first house built. If he is killed, a proper house will need to be built before he can respawn, but has no additional requirements.<br><br>
	 • Provides tips and a general guide on how to acquire other NPCs and provides recipes that include an item that is shown to him.<br><br>

	    • Note that only coins in the main inventory or coin slots are counted; savings stored in a portable storage item like the Piggy Bank do not count toward the requirement. <br><br>
	    • If the Merchant is killed, he will only respawn if the above conditions are met again. This means all players need to have over 50 in their combined inventories.</p>

He will then respawn as long as a vacant House is available.<br><br>
	    • The Goblin Tinkerer's reforge option allows the player to randomize the Modifier for a weapon or accessory, which can make the item better or worse than it was originally. Reforges cost one-third of the item's current value, which can also be affected by its current modifier. The reforge cost is also affected by the Goblin Tinkerer's Happiness, and can be decreased by equipping a Discount Card or Greedy Ring. <br><br>
		• The modifiers of items used in crafting have no effect on the crafted item's modifier. Any modifier given to the newly crafted item will be completely random.<br><br>

	<div class ="container">
	 <p>• The Clothier is an NPC vendor who sells mainly vanity items. He is the same character as the Old Man who guards the Dungeon before Skeletron is defeated. After defeating Skeletron,
		 the Old Man is freed from his curse, and he disappears from the Dungeon's entrance. Once a suitable vacant house is available thereafter, he spawns and sells items. His clothes are no longer tattered, his eyes have turned blue (from red), and he is wearing a Red Hat.<br><br>
	    • Equipping the Clothier Voodoo Doll allows a player to attack and kill the Clothier (similar to the Guide Voodoo Doll). Doing so at night re-summons Skeletron.<br><br>
		• When threatened, the Clothier fires shadowflame skull projectiles similar to those produced by the Book of Skulls. They inflict enemies with the Shadowflame debuff for 5–10 seconds.

	 <p>• The Mechanic is an NPC who sells various mechanisms, as well as Wire Cutters and Wrenches, allowing the player to construct and activate wired devices like traps and critter engines.<br><br>
	    • She can be found in the Dungeon in the Cavern layer or below after killing Skeletron, where she spawns randomly as the stationary Bound Mechanic. Talking to her in this state will free her, after which she will respawn as long as a vacant house is available, even if killed. <br><br>
		• When threatened, the Mechanic will attack nearby enemies. She will throw her Combat Wrench like a boomerang to defend herself, dealing 11 - 19 damage at the start of the game.<br><br>

	<div class ="container">
	 <p>• The Party Girl is a pre-Hardmode NPC vendor who sells festive novelty items and furniture.<br><br>
	    • Unlike most other town NPCs, the Party Girl has a random 1/40 (2.5%) chance to spawn every morning and evening once the criteria below are met, rather than being guaranteed to appear once fulfilling them. This random chance also applies to her respawning following her death. Said criteria require that:<br><br>
		- There is no other NPC waiting to move in.<br>
		- There is an empty house.<br>
        - 8 other town NPCs are in the world. Note that while the Old Man, Traveling Merchant, and town pets count towards this total, the Skeleton Merchant does not.

	<div class ="container">
	 <p>• The Wizard is a Hardmode NPC vendor who sells magic-related items. As soon as the Wall of Flesh has been defeated, he rarely spawns in the cavern layer or below. <br><br>
		• Similar to the Goblin Tinkerer, Mechanic, Golfer, Tavernkeep, and Stylist, he first spawns as the stationary Bound Wizard. Interacting with him will free him, after which he will respawn as long as a vacant house is available, even if killed.<br><br>
	    • When enemies are in his vicinity, the Wizard hurls fireballs at them in a similar fashion to the Flower of Fire while casting an aesthetic magic circle.<br><br>
		• He will occasionally replace his regular quote with a comment about the player's luck. This is the only way to estimate a player's luck value in the game.

	<div class ="container">
	 <p>• The Tax Collector is a Hardmode NPC that taxes other housed NPCs to earn coins for players. He is obtained by throwing Purification Powder on a Tortured Soul, a rare Underworld enemy. The enemy will transform into the Tax Collector, and if killed, he will respawn like all other town NPCs so long as a vacant house is available. <br><br>
		• When the Tax Collector is present, 50 copper coins will be earned per real-world minute (each in-game hour), for each NPC that has a house – including the Tax Collector himself. The Tax Collector stores these funds, up to 25 gold coins.<br><br>
	    • Speaking to him will reveal the amount stored thus far and offer the option to collect. How much he collects per minute varies depending on his current happiness.<br><br>
		• The Tax Collector will attack nearby enemies with his cane to defend himself.

	    • Surface Glowing Mushroom biomes do not generate naturally and therefore must be manually created. 100 blocks of Mushroom grass and Mushroom plants are required to create a Glowing Mushroom biome. <br><br>
		• When threatened by enemies, the Truffle will release Mushroom Spores, which hover in air and deal 10 damage.
